## User-Directory

 

## User Story
```
As a business owner I need a app to sort and search my clients by name.
```
## Website Functionality
```
GIVEN I am on the application
WHEN I search in the left box
THEN it is by first name
WHEN I search in the right box
THEN it is by last name
WHEN I click on the first or last name label
THEN the users will be alphebetically ordered.
```
## Obstacles faced during development
```
I was unable to import table settings from react due to my app name, and having to restart after having too many assignments open at once. 
```
## Instructions for future development
```
I would like to continue working on the CSS as well as making all columns sort.
```
